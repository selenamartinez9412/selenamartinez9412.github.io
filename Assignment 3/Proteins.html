    <div class="h2">Heart Healthy Proteins</div>
    <p>Below is a list of proteins that support optimal brain and heart health. A heart healthy diet contains minimal red meats. Red meats are proven to increase risk for heart disease, such as cancer, diabetes and premature death. This evidence is consistent across different studies. 
		
		Red meats do not necessarily need to be omitted, but definitely should be limited to only once or twice a week. Consider red meats a luxury rather than a daily intake.<br>
      If you struggle to limit red meats, consider the proteins listed below. When transitioning from a red meat diet to a leaner diet, one does not need to comletely change their diet. Using the same recipes but swapping red meats for light meats is an easy way to begin making healthier choices. For example, rather than looking for a new recipe to replace eating hamburgers, consider using ground chicken or turkey to make the same recipe. </p>
