    Quality fats, also known as "good" fats, are the fats found in naturally grown foods. These fats are noted for their "good" fats because they are the complete opposite of the "bad" fats found in processed foods. Good fats are proven to improve heart health and decrease the risk of heart diseases and stroke. Quality fats also assist with energy and eating filling meals. When aiming to eat a more heart healthy diet, avoid trans fats. Trans fats are proven to be linked to heart disease and cholesterol issues. Healthy fats can easily be added to daily meals by incorporaiting nuts and seeds as a daily snack. Natural fats are also a much healthier option as cooking oils. Be aware of the labels on some products, as healthy fats can also commonly hold lots of calories when consumed in large amounts.</div>
