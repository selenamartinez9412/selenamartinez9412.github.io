    <div class="h2">Island of Oahu</div>
    Oahu is a small island with a large population of over 900,000 people. This tiny island is filled with tourist opportunities for families such as the Pearl Harbor Memorial, Iolani Palace, Museums, Beaches, Ziplining and more. Despite all of these touristic opportunities, Oahu is considered one of the most remote cities in the world, with its nearest population being California (2,000 miles away). <br>
    Oahu is filled with culture with its unique traditions and foods. Oahu is also assumed to be the land that founded the traditional ukulele we relate so fondly to Hawaii. <br>
