    Hawaii is not only the name of the state, but the name of the state's largest island. It is nicknamed "The Big Island of Hawaii". This island is larger than each of the other islands combined. The island is 95 miles long and 80 miles wide. This island is still growing due to the lava pouring into the ocean around it. The island's volcano has a controlled flow and is harmless. The island's "Volcanoes National Park" is home to "Kilauea", one of the most active volcanoes in the world. <br>
    This island has a little something for everyone. Family friendly beaches are easily accessible and near the airport in Kona. Driving across the island takes about 2 1/2 hours long, but there are areas stops along the way and small cities to see. <br>
