The <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/behavioral-psychology-4157183#:~:text=Behaviorism%2C%20also%20known%20as%20behavioral,environmental%20stimuli%20shape%20our%20actions." target="_blank">Behaviorist Theory</a> is a concept we have all encountered, whether we realize it or not. This theory theorizes that learned behaviors are enforced through a series of rewards and punishments.  The Behaviorist theories is common when discussing behavior management and <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-behavioral-therapy-2795998" target="_blank">behavioral therapy</a>. This theory is best implemented with concepts that have an absolute desired outcome rather than a creative topic with more student freedom. The purpose of behaviorism is to reinforce positive habits through conditioning and repetition.

    <h4>Examples of when to use behaviorism:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Teaching a classroom to react to a certain gesture given by a teacher like a “call and response”.</li>
      <li>Learning the fundamentals of playing an instrument or rules to a sports game. This is because the rules and posture while performing these tasks have a specific way to accomplish success.</li>
      <li>Memorizing multiplication by repetition and reward.</li>
      <li>Learning appropriate behaviors through repetition. An example of this would be a teacher reinforcing positive behaviors by acknowledging a students kindness. </li>
      <li>Learning a new language through an app such as Duolingo, which teaches language through repetition, correction, and positive reinforcement. </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="h2"> Things to Remember When Utilizing Positive Reinforcement</div>
        <br>
<ul>
      <li>The teacher/instructor’s  role  is to facilitate an activity that allows students to repeat the skill being learned continuously. </li>
      <li>The students’ behavioral responses will be shaped by continuous feedback.</li>
      <li>The learner should have a clear understanding of what is expected of them as soon as possible. </li>
      <li>Repetition is key. </li>
      <li>Continuous reinforcement can seem exhausting, but after the behavior is learned, reinforcing only partially will suffice.</li>
      <li>Click the following link for more information of “Reinforcement Schedules” .</li>
      <li>Ask yourself how you plan to reward the learner and follow through. </li>
      <li>Rewards can be as simple as recognition through verbal praise. </li>
    </ul>
