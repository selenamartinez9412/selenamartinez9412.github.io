      <br>
 A pioneer of the <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/ubcei/enhance/learning/constructivism.html" target="_blank">constructivist theory</a> is Jean Piaget, who believed learning is related to the stage of cognitive development. Lev Vygotsky also contributed to the the constructivist theory while contributing to the social aspect of learning.  Social constructivism is very similar to the studies of Piaget, with the addition of peer influence being a large focus. This method encourages knowledge to be developed when students with different backgrounds, cultures and experiences share their perspective with those around them. Social constructivism emphasizes collaboration and social interaction to encourage<a href="https://elearningindustry.com/discovery-learning-model" target="_blank"> discovery learning</a>. This theory allows students to lead their own learning, encouraging motivation through involvement. Social constructivism is far from the classic form of learning such as lectures and silent textbook reading.

  Constructivist theory in the classroom is based on the idea that learners navigate their own learning and construct their own knowledge. This theory encourages students to learn from one another and encounter the different perspectives of others. A constructivist classroom is student-centered, with the teacher acting only as the facilitator. A benefit to the constructivist method of teaching is that it allows students to learn from each other at their own pace rather than everyone learning through a singular, teacher-led lesson.
<h4>How to implement constructivism</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Students should first have some foundational knowledge to construct upon. </li>
<li>Allot time for student discussion and discovery.</li> 
<li>Use thought provoking questions when gauging understanding. If a question can be answered with a simple “yes” or “no”, rethink how you can better engage students. </li> 
<li>Give students choice of how to express their learning.</li> 
<li>In a constructive classroom, students choose their goals and the teacher facilitates knowledge. </li> 
	</ul>
