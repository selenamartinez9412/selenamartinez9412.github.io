    <div class="h2">Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</div>
        <br>
This theory is based upon the idea that a student's basic needs must be fulfilled before they are able to fulfill personal needs. Basic needs are considered to be essential for safety and survival such as: food, water, shelter and security. Without these basic needs being fulfilled, a student will struggle to fulfill social/emotional needs. <br>
    Understanding Maslow's Hierarchy of needs is important because it helps us understand our students and why they may be unmotivated to fulfill particular needs. These needs range in order and each category can be seen as a stepping stone for the next.<br>
	  The highest level of needs is Self-actualization, where a student seeks realization of their potential and self-fulfillment. The following video visually explains Maslow's Hierarchy of needs.
