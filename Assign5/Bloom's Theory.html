    <div class="h2">Bloom's Taxonomy</div>
    <br>
    Bloom's Taxomony focuses on the order in which information is presented to the learner and its impact on influencing affective learning. The theory suggests that there are two major forms of thinking skills, lower-order thinking skills and higher-order thinking skills. Within the lower-order thinking process, students are introduced to the subject by learning basic concepts such as descriptions and vocabulary. Once a student has grasped these basic elements of their learning, they move on to higher-order thinking skills. Higher order thinking involves student-centered learning and self-constructed goals. The student learns how to form their own opinion and create their own version of their understanding. The goal when using this theory is to guide students through a process of teacher-guided learning to self-motivated learning.<br>

    <div class="h2">Increasing Rigor in Small Steps</div>
    The greatest advantage of Bloom's Taxonomy is the relief from frustration it is intended to allow students. When starting from the bottom of Bloom's Taxonomy and slowly increasing the rigor, students of all skills levels have a chance to learn. In an average classroom, students may range from inexperienced to very experienced in a particular subject. Beginning from the bottom of Bloom's Taxonomy and increasing rigor gradually will ensure that students of all levels are adept and ready to move on to the next stage. <br>
    Below are the stages of Blooms Taxonomy and examples of the terminology you would use when creating assignments at each level.
