    <br>
	  These 4 major learning theories, constructivist, behaviorist, cognitive and humanist are relevant to our experiences within education and can help us understand the learning processes of ourselvse and others. These learning theories tend to coincide, as they each have their appropriate uses. The purpose of this website is to help instructors identify these learning theories and understand how to properly implement them within lessons. <br>

  <div class="h2">Thinking Outside of the Box</div>
 <br>
	If a learner is not engaged, they are not learning. Making learning about the learner is an essential aspect of how the learning process becomes affective. <br>
  Think back to a time when you genuinely enjoyed learning. Changes are, there was an activity involved, impacting your excitement level. Perhaps you were able to relate the topic to something exciting for you. Maybe there was a fun activity involved, or an opportunity to share your thoughts. Maybe you were asked to perform a task with a friend. <br>
  On the other hand, think of a learning activity you absolutely dreaded. What aspects of this negative lesson made the experience unenjoyable? Was it the expectation to focus while being absolutely bored? Was it the assessment process? Was the material unrelatable to anything of interest for you? <br>
  As an instructor, these moments are important to note and reflelct upon. They are not uncommon and can fully impact the retention of knowledge. When learning about each of these learning theories, note the relation you may have to each theory. Perhaps you've experienced these theories in your own learning or in the lessons you teach. </div>
