    <h2 class="h2">Rocky Mountain National Park</h2>
    <p>The Rocky Mountain National Park is located north of Denver and is quite chilly for most of the year. We visited this national park in early November during their off season. We stayed in a quaint little town called "Estes Park" right outside of the national park. As Texans, we had never seen snow and had high hopes to visit the park to see some fun winter weather. We drove towards higher altitude and finally saw wintery weather like we had never seen before. This trip included much less hiking than the others but we drove around and saw beautiful sights throughout the park.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Recommendations</h2>
    <p>It is always important to view a national park's website before visiting the park. I would especially recommend visiting this park's website before visiting. The weather is subject to change drastically. Roads are closed when ice is detected. If you appreciate an empty park like I do, I recommend visiting this park during their off season. However, parts of the park will be closed. There was still plenty for us to see and do in November.</p>
