    <h2 class="h2">Zion National Park</h2>
  <p>Zion National Park is located in southern Utah and is hidden beyond the mountains. Hiking in Zion was everything I imagined and more. I visited Zion National Park in the Fall when the leaves were changing colors. The scenery was beautiful. I've been to multiple state parks at this point and Zion had the most rewarding and breathtaking hikes thus far. If Zion is not on your bucketlist, I recommend you add it.</p></div>

	  <h2 class="h2">Tourist Information</h2>
	  <p>The hikes in Zion are not meant for those afraid of heights. The hikes in Zion can be extreme and I recommend taking the safety precautions in the park very seriously before venturing. The views are amazing, but the hike to the top was terrifying. Checking the weather forecast is also very important in this park. Zion is technically located in the desert, meaning the mornings are very cold, but mid-day hours can become very hot. I actually ran out of water on the way down from this hike although I had a gallon in my Camelback! Pictured to the right is my husband having difficulties looking over the cliff at the top of a hike. Below are more images of the beautiful scenery.  Enjoy!</p></div>
