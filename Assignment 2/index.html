    <h2 class="h2">My Adventures</h2>
    <p>Getting out into the great outdoors is my favorite hobby. Recently, I purchased a National Parks Stamp Book to collect a memory of each national park I have visited. So far, I have only visited 10 out of the 63 national parks in the United States. I have the ultimate goal of learning how to backpack and exploring all 63 national parks! I even plan to visit those in Alaska and Hawaii. Exploring national parks is an important hobby to me because it fuels my determination to stay healthy and fit enough to venture on these extreme hikes. National parks can feel a bit daunting when preparing for the wilderness, and always present a new challenge. Safety and planning are always my top priority when planning a trip into a national park. In this site I list a few parks I have visited so far, and a few tips I learned along the way.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">What is a National Park Stamp Book?</h2>
    <p>A national park stamp book can be purchased at any of the national park visitor centers or online. Each national park has its own unique ink stamp and postal stamp. When visiting a national park, I bring my stamp book to keep record of the parks I have been to. Stamping the book is a lot of fun and I look forward to it with each visit.
