    <h2 class="h2">Great Sand Dunes</h2>
  <p>The Great Sand Dunes National Park was hands down the most intense hike I have ever experienced! We arrived on a windy day with the ambition of climbing up a large dune and sledding down it. The hike took about 3 hours and varied in incline the entire way up. My shoes were heavy from sand and but each hill was another amazing view. I loved this hike, however, I'm not sure I'll ever sign up to do it again. It was definitely a once in a lifetime experience that I will cherish forever. </p></div>

	  <h2 class="h2">Recommendations</h2>
	  <p>This hike was definitely worth training for. Although I was young and fit at the time, I should have definitely trained more before setting out on this hike. I recommend training before attempting this hike. On another note, the great part about this hike was the lack of trees. I know that may sound strange, but the visibility from each point was amazing! Other hikes have trees that block your view, but we were able to look down and see just how far we came every step of the way. I definitely recommend bringing something to sled down. Bringing a boogie board made coming back down fun and quick.</p></div>
