    <h2 class="h2">Bryce Canyon National Park</h2>
    <p>Bryce Canyon is located around eastern Utah and is surrounded by beauty. This canyon is constructed by formations called "hoodoos" like those you see here in these photos. These hoodoos were formed by large bodies of water running through them millions of years ago as the ocean waters receeded away from what is now Utah. <br>
	Bryce Canyon was my first major national park hike. The hike was about 3 miles, but was very intense. We hiked down to the bottom of the canyon where we were able to look up at the hoodoos around us. The canyon changes drastically throughout the hike. We were able to walk through tight areas and through formations I'm unsure I will ever be able to see anywhere else. This part of Utah must be one of the most unique areas of the United States, in my opinion.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Recommendations</h2>
	<p>After completing this hike, I would recommend that anyone considering hiking in Bryce Canyon remember that this canyon is technically considered a desert. Our morning starded nice and cool, but the climate changed throughout the day. Bring plenty of water and dress in layers. It is also important to note that there is no water or bathroom at any point during this hike. Once we were at the bottom of this canyon, there's no way out but to complete the rest of the hike.

	We had a great time hiking through the hoodoos of Bryce Canyon. I cannot stress how interesting and unique the displays in the canyon were. There is nothing like it in the world. The area around Bryce Canyon was also very intersting, as "Escelante National Monument" claims a large area around the park. We ventured in Escelante the day after visiting Bryce Canyon and saw dinosaur prints and slot canyons. (Slot canyon pictured below)</p></div>
